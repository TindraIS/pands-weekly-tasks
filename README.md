## Weekly Tasks

### 01: helloworld.py


### 02: bank.py

    When Banks are storing currency figures, they store them as integers (usually in cent). 
    This is to avoid rounding errors. Write a program called bank.py The program should:
        * Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
        * Add the two amounts
        * Print out the answer in a human readable format with a 
        euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount 


##### Rationale

Problem solving inspiration in a [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71041895/using-floor-division-and-modulo-together)

### 03: accounts.py

    Bank account numbers can stored as 10 character strings, for security reasons some applications only display the last 4 characters (with the other other characters replaced with Xs).
    Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).


##### Rationale
Problem solving inspiration: https://realpython.com/len-python-function/
While reading about the len function found some examples with while loops
