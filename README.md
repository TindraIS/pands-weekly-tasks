### 02: bank.py

    When Banks are storing currency figures, they store them as integers (usually in cent). 
    This is to avoid rounding errors. Write a program called bank.py The program should:
        * Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
        * Add the two amounts
        * Print out the answer in a human readable format with a 
        euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount 


##### Rationale

Problem solving approach based on a [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71041895/using-floor-division-and-modulo-together)

### 03: accounts.py

    Bank account numbers can stored as 10 character strings, for security reasons some 
    applications only display the last 4 characters (with the other other characters replaced with Xs).
    Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs 
    the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).


##### Rationale
Problem solving approach based on the ```len()``` function article in [Real Python](https://realpython.com/len-python-function/)
which contains a few examples with while loops.
